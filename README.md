Http Requester
==============

A simple Java application to send HTTP requests. Created as an exercise for the Java course I took in Bruges.

Getting started
---------------

You can lauch the application in the Swing GUI (default), or use it in the command line.  
To use the command line version, add the -cli switch.

### Command line options

The options will have no effect if you're using the GUI.

- `-cli | --cli` Run on the command line.
- `-q | --quiet` Show no output (quiet mode).
- `-d | --data` Show response data.
- `-h | --headers` Show response headers.
- `-t n | --threads n` Set the number of threads to use.
- `-r n | --requests n` Set the number of requests to send.
- `-c | --check-url` Check if the URL is valid before starting.
- `-s n | --sleep n` Set the number of milliseconds between requests.
- `-u url | --url url` The url to send the requests to.
